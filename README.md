# Simple Academic Website Template


## Description
Simple, intuitive, mobile-friendly (Bootstrap-enabled) website for academics entering the market.

Many academics entering the market today are served by having a digital footprint which describes their research, teaching, and other relevant experience. While many 3rd-party hosted solutions exist, such as Wordpress.com, for those familiar with HTML and who wish to have their own hosted domain, this simple  simple template offers a quick way to get a presence online. It's also useful to experiment with HTML, CSS and the [Bootstrap Framework](https://getbootstrap.com/getting-started/).

## Documentation

Bootstrap's documentation, included in this repo in the root directory, is built with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com) and publicly hosted on GitHub Pages at <https://getbootstrap.com>. The docs may also be run locally.

Documentation search is powered by [Algolia's DocSearch](https://community.algolia.com/docsearch/). Working on our search? Be sure to set `debug: true` in the `_scripts.html` include.

### Running documentation locally

1. Run through the [tooling setup](https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap/blob/v4-dev/docs/4.0/getting-started/build-tools.md#tooling-setup) to install Jekyll (the site builder) and other Ruby dependencies with `bundle install`.
2. Run `npm install` to install Node.js dependencies.
3. Run `npm run test` (or a specific NPM script) to rebuild distributed CSS and JavaScript files, as well as our docs assets.
4. From the root `/bootstrap` directory, run `npm run docs-serve` in the command line.
5. Open <http://localhost:9001> in your browser, and voilà.

Learn more about using Jekyll by reading its [documentation](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/home/).
